=============
In June 2017, the MSDN subscriber portal was "taken offline", with the new Visual Studio portal only being open to subscribers.
While it worked for a few months after showing/hiding some DOM elements, it was finally completely removed in October 2017, with Visual Studio Subscriptions being its replacement.  
This project aims to preserve the file catalogs of Microsoft's software subscription services for reference purposes.

### Instructions
It's mostly your typical Django project.
Copy `settings_private.example.py` to `settings_private.py` and put your configuration in there.

### VS Subscriptions support
Support for Visual Studio Subscriptions files may come sometime in 2021, making this a complete reference for new software going forward.
